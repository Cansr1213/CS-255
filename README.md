Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

A: The central focus of the course was DriverPass, which aimed to tackle the problem of inadequate driver education. Based on their findings, over 65% of individuals do not pass their driving tests at the DMV. The primary objective of this project was to enhance driver training by offering online courses and live instruction.

What did you do particularly well?

A: Thanks to this course, I've really improved my ability to break down systems and illustrate abstract ideas in a visual manner. The diagrams I put together to showcase classes, activities, sequences, and data flow actually helped me grasp the concepts better, and I believe I executed them effectively.I still need to do some work on it but felt I had a better understanding of diagram structure. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
A: The choice for me is easy, I would rework and adjust my diagrams. I had trouble with constructing them for some reason. I can construct and compile code easy but for some reason UML diagrams was my biggest struggle. I would improve my diagram to have better flow and clearity of my diagrams. I felt like at time my diagrams were either sloppy or not enough information. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A: Right from the beginning, I based my system design approach on catering to user needs. I created diagrams that mirrored what I thought users would do. When it came to the class diagram, I took cues from the sequence and activity diagrams to predict how each class would be used. If we don't carefully consider user needs, the system design could end up being too abstract to actually solve the problems it's meant to address.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
A: When it comes to designing software, I always start by getting a clear picture of the problem and understanding what the users need. It's super important to know what the system is supposed to achieve and who's going to use it. After nailing down these basics, I like to use a mix of techniques. I create different diagrams like class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams to map out the system's structure and how all its parts interact. These visual aids help me get a good handle on the system's architecture.

I also consider making wireframes or prototypes to give a real feel for the user interface and experience. This way, we can test things early and make sure the final product lines up with what the users expect. In the future, I'll stick to the user-centered approach, making sure their needs are a top priority. Gathering feedback from users and stakeholders on a regular basis is something I've found really valuable. And, with technology always changing, I'll keep an eye out for new tools and methodologies to keep improving the design process.
